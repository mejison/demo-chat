# TypeScript
This codebase uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Ideally, for the most part, all JavaScript code should be written in TypeScript and fully typed. However, `strict` has been set to `false` due to some developers may not have the most experience with it. By setting `strict` to `true`, developers could experience ts compile errors for seeming no reason if they do not understand it. However, this does not mean that the code is broken, only poorly typed.
